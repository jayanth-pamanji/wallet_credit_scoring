# üè¶ DeFi Wallet Credit Scoring using Aave V2 Protocol

This project scores wallets on a scale of **1 to 1000** based on their historical activity on the **Aave V2 protocol**. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, the goal is to assign relative credit scores to help DeFi lending platforms or researchers better understand wallet behavior and potential creditworthiness.

---

## üîç Project Goals

* Extract and preprocess Aave V2 on-chain wallet transaction data
* Engineer features that capture wallet behavior
* Cluster wallets using unsupervised techniques (KMeans, DBSCAN)
* Normalize and assign credit scores (1 to 1000) based on behavioral clusters
* Analyze score distributions and wallet behaviors

---

## üìÇ Dataset Description

* **Source**: Aave V2 Protocol (Polygon Network)
* **Size**: 100,000+ transaction entries
* **Actions**: `deposit`, `borrow`, `repay`, `redeemunderlying`, `liquidationcall`
* **Format**: JSON-like documents containing fields like:

  * `userWallet`, `timestamp`, `action`, `asset`, `amount`, `price_usd`, etc.

| `has_liquidation`                     | Binary, if wallet was liquidated            |
| `max_tx_usd`, `median_tx_usd`         | Extremes of transaction size                |
| `is_active`                           | Binary, if wallet has meaningful activity   |

## ü§ñ Clustering

* **PCA**: Reduced to 13 principal components
* **KMeans**:

  * Chosen `n_clusters=20` based on elbow/variance curve
  * Wallets within each cluster scored based on behavioral quality
* **DBSCAN**:

  * Density-based clustering to detect noise wallets
  * Noise wallets were assigned lowest scores

---

## üî¢ Scoring Strategy

* Clusters were ranked manually based on average:

  * Volume, frequency, stability, and action diversity
* Scores were scaled between **1 and 1000**
* Better clusters (healthier wallets) got higher scores

## üëÅ‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Visualization & Output

* Score distribution
* Histogram by cluster
* Exported CSVs:

  * `cleaned_wallet_data.csv`
  * `wallet_features.csv`
  * `wallet_scores.csv`
