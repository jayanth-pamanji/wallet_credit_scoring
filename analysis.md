## ðŸ’² Behavior of Low-Scoring Wallets (0â€“300)

- Minimal or no activity
- Mostly `redeemunderlying`, occasional `liquidationcall`
- Very low transaction volume
- No signs of consistent engagement with Aave
- Often considered noisy or one-off wallets

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Behavior of High-Scoring Wallets (700â€“1000)

- Active on multiple days
- Consistent use of `deposit`, `borrow`, `repay`
- Strong behavioral consistency in volume and timing
- No liquidation events
- Likely long-term users of the protocol

---

## ðŸ“Š Insights

- Majority of wallets fall in lower score buckets (due to inactivity)
- Higher scoring wallets demonstrate deeper integration with Aave
- DBSCAN detected 300+ wallets as noise (score ~0)
- Scores help filter trustworthy vs inactive wallets for further DeFi analysis
